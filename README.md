# Account Manager Application
by Karl Mhlanga
## Project Overview
This project includes a mock backend and a frontend application for managing account statuses, services, payments, and orders.

## Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `mock-backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `node server.js`
4. The server runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. The frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## File Structure
- `mock-backend/`: Contains the mock backend server code.
- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend application.

## Notes
- Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend application.
- The frontend application will attempt to fetch data from the backend server running at `http://localhost:5000`.
- If you encounter any issues, make sure to check the server logs and browser console for errors.

## Additional Considerations
- If the backend server is running on a different port or address, update the API URLs in the frontend code accordingly.
- Review the code quality and ensure that the application is functional before final submission.
